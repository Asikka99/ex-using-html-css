		<h2>This is My First  Article</h2>
		<p class="quote">My grandma is the one who got me into books when I was a young child (thank you Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew!), but she is also responsible for my later-acquired affection for some of the best cozy mystery series. After she lost most of her sight, she received audiobooks through the free service offered by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. Every time I would visit her, she would tell me about the “crazy antics” in her latest Rita Mae Brown book. She also loved to watch the Hallmark Movie Channel and I found I could watch a couple of those movies without even realizing it.</p>

        <p>This list focuses on the best cozy mystery series with two or more published books available. Long-running series work so well in this genre because we fall in love with the main characters and want to spend more and more time with them.</p> 

        <p>Trying to put together a top any-number of cozy mystery series is an impossible task because there are so many great ones out there. (In fact, this started as a top 10 list, but I couldn’t narrow it down.) So, please, feel free to add your favorites in the comments of this post!</p>
